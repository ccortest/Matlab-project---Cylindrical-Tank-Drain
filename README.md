Hello guys, let me show the first project where i was analyzing and applying ODE(Ordinary differential equations) models on MATLAB, specifically for draining tanks with some different geometric designs, for this case i decided to apply it for cylindrical tank. This simulation can be useful for design and understand how it works ODE in calculus and prediction models. I will upload more geometrical models in this repository, obviously can be corrected and improved. After this I will try apply this concepts in another programming languages and applying another current  techniques(more efficients).
